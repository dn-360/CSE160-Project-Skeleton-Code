I planned to implement flooding using channels.
The nodes will send a message to its neighbors.  
The program fires a timer and broadcasts addresses. It will check for a reply from a neighbor node and floods again if there is no check. It will flood until the runtime is over. 
This approach allows every path to be explored and packets to be delivered if there are neighbors.
